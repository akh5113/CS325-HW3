This file will execute with using numbers from a text file called "amount.txt".
It will read this file in the format:
[coin1, coin2, ... , coinN]
[total]
Where the lines alternate from a list of coin denominations seperated by a space,
then the following line will have the total amount needed to make change for. 

To run this file on flip, include the .py file in the same folder as amount.txt and run
"python3 Homework3.py" on the command line on flip. 

This program creates a text file that contains the output, "change.txt". The outupt file
will conain the information from the input file, "amount.txt", and then an additional
line that shows the number of each coin needed.
[coin1, coin2, ... , coinN]
[total]
[num1, num2, ... , numN]
